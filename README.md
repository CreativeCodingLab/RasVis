# RasVis: Redesigning Pathways to Support Analyses of Experimental Data 

Static biological pathway diagrams represent biochemical relationships between particular biomolecular elements within a cell. Our cancer biology collaborators research noncoding RNA "dark matter" in pluripotent stem cells and cancer, informing RNA-based precision medicine approaches to detect and treat cancer early on. We worked closely with them to develop new pathway representations to make it easier to investigate how mutations in the RAS protein family affect noncoding RNAs and to visualize causal relationships between transcription events and interferon simulated genes, which may provide deeper insight in to the mechanics of RAS-related cancers.

Existing tools are not well-suited to focus only on specific elements of interest within a pathway or to find connections between elements across multiple pathways. Automated pathway generation tools can produce diagrams that may introduce visual clutter, while manually curated pathways (e.g., available from KEGG or Reactome) often include details that are irrelevant to a particular analysis or empirical investigation (as in Figs. 1 and 2).
